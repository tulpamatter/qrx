# Important
- THIS MUST FIT IN A QR CODE SO USE SHORT CREATIVE TECHNIQUES (but dont obfuscate code since it runs thru a minifier anyways)
- USE COMMENTS TO ANNOTATE COMPLEX THINGS (these get removed on build)
- DO NOT USE SEMICOLONS - they are not aesthetic
- DO NOT USE const USE let INSTEAD - this saves you 2 bytes per declaration
- USE && AND || TO SHORTHAND IF CONDITIONALS (eg `a && b()` instead of `if (a) {b()}`
